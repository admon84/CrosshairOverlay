# CrosshairOverlay ðŸŽ¯

CrosshairOverlay is a simple C# application that draws a customizable crosshair on your screen, perfect for keeping your aim steady. Designed specifically for Windows users.

### Disclaimer

CrosshairOverlay does not alter any game code or files; it simply overlays a crosshair on your screen. However, some games may consider this to be cheating as it modifies the player's experience. Use it at your own risk, and be aware that using CrosshairOverlay in online games could lead to penalties, bans, or other consequences imposed by game developers or administrators.
